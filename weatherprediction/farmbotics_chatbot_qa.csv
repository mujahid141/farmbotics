What crop grows best in sandy soil?,"Sandy soil provides excellent drainage and is ideal for crops that require loose, aerated conditions. Peanuts thrive because their pods develop underground and need well-drained soil to avoid rot. Carrots grow straight and long in sandy soil due to its soft structure. Potatoes also do well, as sandy soil minimizes the risk of fungal infections and promotes healthy tuber development. To improve fertility, add compost or organic matter to enhance nutrient retention."
Which crop is good for pH level 6.0?,"A pH of 6.0 is slightly acidic and is suitable for a wide range of crops. Barley, wheat, and corn are particularly well-suited for this pH level. At pH 6.0, essential nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium are readily available, supporting healthy plant growth. Regular soil testing and lime application can help maintain this optimal range."
When should I plant wheat in Punjab?,"In Punjab, wheat is ideally sown between mid-November and early December, right after harvesting the rice crop. This timing allows the crop to take advantage of the cool growing season and ensures a good yield. Delayed sowing may reduce tillering and lower overall productivity."
What is the ideal temperature for rice?,"Rice grows best in warm climates with temperatures ranging from 20°C to 35°C. Germination occurs at 20–25°C, while the best growth and grain filling happen at 25–30°C. High temperatures during flowering above 35°C may reduce yield, so temperature control through timely sowing is essential."
How can I improve soil fertility?,"To enhance soil fertility, use compost, green manure, and well-decomposed organic matter. Crop rotation with legumes can naturally fix nitrogen in the soil. Avoid overuse of chemical fertilizers, and consider using biofertilizers. Periodic soil testing helps you apply nutrients based on actual soil needs, ensuring long-term productivity."
